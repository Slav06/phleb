# Lab Partnerships System

## Overview

The platform now supports multiple lab partnerships beyond Quality Laboratory. This system allows admins to onboard new labs, manage their test types, and provide a flexible structure for expanding lab services.

## New Features

### 1. Lab Management
- **Add/Edit Labs**: Admins can create new lab partnerships with details like name, address, logo, and contact information
- **Lab Status**: Labs can be marked as active or inactive
- **Lab Branding**: Each lab can have its own logo and branding

### 2. Test Type Management
- **Test Types per Lab**: Each lab can have its own set of test types
- **Pricing**: Cash prices are managed per test type
- **Tube Colors**: Each test type specifies the required tube top color
- **Test Descriptions**: Detailed descriptions for each test type

### 3. Dynamic Form Integration
- **Lab Selection**: Blood draw forms now dynamically load available labs
- **Test Type Selection**: Once a lab is selected, available test types are loaded
- **Pricing Display**: Test prices are shown in the selection dropdown

## Database Schema

### New Tables

#### `labs` Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE public.labs (
  id uuid DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4() PRIMARY KEY,
  name text NOT NULL,
  address text,
  logo_url text,
  contact_email text,
  contact_phone text,
  is_active boolean DEFAULT true,
  created_at timestamp with time zone DEFAULT timezone('utc'::text, now()) NOT NULL,
  updated_at timestamp with time zone DEFAULT timezone('utc'::text, now()) NOT NULL
);
```

#### `test_types` Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE public.test_types (
  id uuid DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4() PRIMARY KEY,
  lab_id uuid REFERENCES public.labs(id) ON DELETE CASCADE NOT NULL,
  name text NOT NULL,
  description text,
  cash_price numeric(10,2) NOT NULL,
  tube_top_color text,
  is_active boolean DEFAULT true,
  created_at timestamp with time zone DEFAULT timezone('utc'::text, now()) NOT NULL,
  updated_at timestamp with time zone DEFAULT timezone('utc'::text, now()) NOT NULL
);
```

### Updated Tables

#### `submissions` Table
- Added `lab_id` (references labs.id)
- Added `test_type_id` (references test_types.id)
- Removed `lab_brand` (replaced with lab_id)

## Admin Interface

- **Bulk Operations**: View all test types in one place
- **Status Management**: Activate/deactivate labs and test types

## User Interface Updates

### Blood Draw Form
- **Dynamic Lab Selection**: Dropdown populated with active labs
- **Dynamic Test Type Selection**: Dropdown populated with test types for selected lab
- **Price Display**: Shows test price and tube color in selection
- **Validation**: Test type selection is disabled until lab is selected

### Mobile Lab Dashboard

## Migration

### Database Migration
Run the migration script to update existing databases:
```sql
-- Run src/database/migrate_to_lab_partnerships.sql
```

### Data Migration
Quality Laboratory is automatically added as the first lab with common test types:
```sql
-- Run src/database/insert_quality_lab.sql
```

## Utility Functions

### `src/utils/labUtils.js`
Provides centralized functions for lab operations:

- `getLabs()` - Get all active labs
- `getTestTypes()` - Get all active test types
- `getTestTypesByLab(labId)` - Get test types for a specific lab
- `getLabById(labId)` - Get lab by ID
- `getTestTypeById(testTypeId)` - Get test type by ID
- `getLabOptions()` - Get lab options for forms
- `getTestTypeOptions(labId)` - Get test type options for forms
- `clearLabCache()` - Clear cached lab data

### Caching
Lab and test type data is cached for 5 minutes to improve performance and reduce database calls.

## API Integration

### Supabase Policies
- **Labs**: Anyone can view active labs, admins can manage all
- **Test Types**: Anyone can view active test types, admins can manage all
- **Submissions**: Users can only access their own submissions

### Row Level Security
All new tables have RLS enabled with appropriate policies for data security.
